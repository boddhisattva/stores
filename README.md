stores
======

This is a sample stores app. It's not a complete app. I've just used this as a proof of concept to show how one can integrate AM charts with Rails. Also, I've experimented with day to day Rails stuff on this project as well.

To check out the sample AM charts implementation you can try this link - http://localhost:3000/companies/company_division_stats
